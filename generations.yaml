generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XK30/XK40)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Tundra marked Toyota's entry into the full-size pickup truck segment in North America, though with dimensions slightly smaller than domestic competitors, positioning it initially as an 'almost full-size' offering. Available in regular and extended cab (Access Cab) configurations with multiple bed lengths, the original Tundra featured relatively conservative styling that didn't stray far from established pickup truck design conventions. Engine options included a 3.4-liter V6 (later a 4.0-liter) and a 4.7-liter V8 producing 245 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior focused on durability and practicality, with straightforward controls and relatively modest materials even in higher trim levels. Four-wheel drive models featured a part-time system with a two-speed transfer case, providing reasonable off-road capability though not specifically focused on extreme terrain. A notable milestone occurred in 2003 when Toyota began producing the Tundra in a new plant in San Antonio, Texas—a strategic move to strengthen the truck's American credentials. This generation established Toyota in the full-size truck market, capitalizing on the brand's reputation for reliability and quality while laying the groundwork for its future expansion in this lucrative segment, though it struggled to capture significant market share from established domestic competitors due to its somewhat undersized proportions and lower towing and payload capacities."

  - name: "Second Generation (XK50)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Tundra represented Toyota's full commitment to the traditional full-size truck segment, growing substantially in size, capability, and power to compete directly with domestic offerings from Ford, Chevrolet, and Ram. Available in regular cab, double cab, and CrewMax configurations with multiple bed lengths, this generation featured bold, imposing styling with a massive grille, pronounced fender flares, and an overall more substantial presence clearly targeting American truck buyers' preferences. Engine options initially included a 4.0-liter V6, 4.7-liter V8, and a new 5.7-liter V8 producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, the latter providing competitive performance and towing capacity of up to 10,400 pounds when properly equipped. Transmission options centered around a five-speed automatic for smaller engines and a six-speed automatic for the 5.7-liter. The interior saw significant improvements in design, space, and material quality, particularly in higher trim levels like the luxurious Platinum and 1794 Edition (named after the founding date of the ranch where the San Antonio plant was built), which offered premium leather, wood trim, and enhanced technology features. Off-road capability was addressed with the TRD Off-Road package and later the more comprehensive TRD Pro model featuring specialized suspension, all-terrain tires, and unique styling elements. Safety features expanded throughout the long production run, eventually including the Toyota Safety Sense-P suite with pre-collision system, lane departure alert, automatic high beams, and dynamic radar cruise control. Despite receiving relatively modest updates over its 14-year production run—a remarkably long lifecycle for a modern vehicle—the second-generation Tundra maintained respectable sales through its reputation for exceptional reliability and durability, with many examples surpassing 250,000 miles with minimal issues. This generation established the Tundra as a legitimate, full-size competitor in the truck market, though it never approached the sales volumes of the dominant domestic players."

  - name: "Third Generation (XK70)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Tundra represents a comprehensive redesign, featuring bold, highly angular styling with an enormous grille, squared-off wheel arches, and an overall more assertive presence than its predecessor. Built on Toyota's new TNGA-F body-on-frame platform shared with the latest Land Cruiser and Lexus LX, the new Tundra adopts a coil spring rear suspension replacing the previous leaf springs—a significant change improving ride quality and handling while maintaining competitive payload and towing capabilities. Available in extended cab (Double Cab) and crew cab (CrewMax) configurations with multiple bed lengths, the third-generation Tundra notably eliminates the regular cab option, reflecting shifting market preferences. The most dramatic change is the powertrain lineup, with the previously offered V8 engines replaced by a standard 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (branded as i-FORCE) producing 389 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, and an optional hybrid variant (i-FORCE MAX) adding an electric motor integrated into the transmission for a combined 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torque. Both engines pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard and part-time four-wheel drive optional. Towing capacity reaches up to 12,000 pounds when properly equipped, while payload capacity tops out at 1,940 pounds. The interior features a complete redesign with a horizontally oriented dashboard, standard 8-inch or available 14-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and significantly improved materials throughout. Available in multiple trim levels ranging from the work-oriented SR to the luxury-focused Platinum and 1794 Edition to the off-road-capable TRD Pro, the Tundra offers configurations to suit various preferences and requirements. Technology includes an available 360-degree camera system, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a virtual display rearview mirror. Standard safety features are comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 offering pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, dynamic radar cruise control, lane tracing assist, and automatic high beams. The third-generation Tundra aims to combine the legendary reliability that defined its predecessor with significantly improved refinement, technology, and efficiency while maintaining competitive capability in the fiercely contested full-size truck segment."
